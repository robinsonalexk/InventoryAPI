# InventoryAPI

This was a part of a project given by a prospective employer to produce a deliverable within a set period of time. The API is built in C# .NET Core 3.1 and has
a swagger integration to view endpoints. NUNIT tests are configured along with MOQ for spoofing DB values. This was also built in a DB first pattern so will require a 
db schema matching the models present (POSTGRES in particular)
